I have a particular problem that has to do with curriculum implementation in a college class that uses instructure canvas. My students do a weekly project during the semester and each project has an assignment page on canvas. On that page are the requirements, etc, but more importantly, the page contains the links to the two lectures I gave that week on YouTube. These are live streamed the week of the class. Is there a way to set these links well before the semester begins, then just update what they're pointing at after the lectures are completed? I want to avoid copying and pasting from YouTube every week if possible.

Edit
You're dealing with a common workflow challenge in Canvas, and there are several approaches that can streamline this process significantly.

Best Solution: Use Consistent URL Structure with Redirects

The most elegant approach is to create your own redirect system:

Set up a simple redirect page on your own website/domain (or use a URL shortener service that allows editing)
Create consistent URLs like:
yoursite.com/week1-lecture1
yoursite.com/week1-lecture2
yoursite.com/week2-lecture1
etc.
Add these permanent links to Canvas at the beginning of the semester
Update the redirects each week to point to the actual YouTube URLs after streaming
Alternative Canvas-Native Solutions:

Option 1: Canvas External Tools/LTI If your institution supports it, you could embed a simple custom LTI tool that dynamically pulls YouTube URLs from a spreadsheet or database you update.

Option 2: Canvas API Automation Write a script using Canvas's REST API to automatically update assignment pages. You'd maintain a spreadsheet with YouTube URLs and run the script weekly to update all relevant pages.

Option 3: Placeholder YouTube Videos Create unlisted placeholder videos on YouTube for each week, add those links to Canvas initially, then replace the actual video content by uploading over the placeholders (keeping the same YouTube URL).

Practical Recommendation: Given your technical background with Unity, the redirect approach is probably your best bet. It's simple, reliable, and gives you complete control. You could even build a small web interface to manage the redirects if you're handling many classes.

The Canvas API approach would be more automated but requires more initial setup. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?




Could I use a github repository  for the option 1 strategy? I could update the links in the repository?

Edit
Yes, absolutely! GitHub can work very well for this redirect strategy. Here are the most practical approaches:

Option 1: GitHub Pages with HTML Redirects Create a simple repository structure like:

week1-lecture1.html
week1-lecture2.html
week2-lecture1.html
etc.
Each HTML file contains a simple redirect:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID">
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to lecture...</p>
</body>
</html>
Your Canvas links would be:

https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/week1-lecture1.html
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/week1-lecture2.html
Option 2: GitHub Pages with JavaScript (More Flexible) Use a single index.html with URL parameters:

html
<!-- index.html -->
<script>
const links = {
    'week1-lecture1': 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO1',
    'week1-lecture2': 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO2',
    // etc.
};

const param = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('lecture');
if (links[param]) {
    window.location.href = links[param];
}
</script>
Canvas links: https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/?lecture=week1-lecture1

Workflow:

Set up the repository with placeholder YouTube links at semester start
After each lecture, simply edit the files/data in GitHub (via web interface or git)
Changes go live immediately via GitHub Pages
This approach gives you version control of your links, is completely free, and you can update from anywhere. Would you like me to help you set up the specific structure?




ys, how would I impliment option 2

Edit
I'll walk you through implementing Option 2 step by step:


GitHub Pages Lecture Redirect System
Interactive artifact 
Now here's how to implement this system:

Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new public repository (e.g., "lecture-redirects")
Create a new file called index.html
Copy the code from the artifact above into that file
Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
In your repository, go to Settings > Pages
Under "Source", select Deploy from a branch
Choose main branch and / (root)
Click Save
Your site will be available at: https://yourusername.github.io/lecture-redirects
Step 3: Set Up Canvas Links
In Canvas, use these URLs for your assignment pages:

Week 1 Lecture 1: https://yourusername.github.io/lecture-redirects/?lecture=week1-lecture1
Week 1 Lecture 2: https://yourusername.github.io/lecture-redirects/?lecture=week1-lecture2
Week 2 Lecture 1: https://yourusername.github.io/lecture-redirects/?lecture=week2-lecture1
etc.
Step 4: Weekly Updates
After each lecture:

Go to your GitHub repository
Click on index.html
Click the pencil icon (Edit)
Find the appropriate week/lecture entry
Replace the placeholder URL with your actual YouTube URL
Commit the changes
Example update:

javascript
'week1-lecture1': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID',
Benefits:
Set up once at semester start
Update takes 30 seconds per lecture
Works from any device with web access
Students get a nice loading page instead of broken links
Version control tracks all your changes
The system includes error handling, so if a student clicks a link before you've updated it, they'll get a helpful message instead of a broken redirect.

Would you like me to modify anything about this setup or help you customize it further?
